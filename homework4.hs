Exercise 1: Wholemeal programming
Reimplement each of the following functions in a more idiomatic
Haskell style. Use wholemeal programming practices, breaking each
function into a pipeline of incremental transformations to an entire
data structure. Name your functions fun1’ and fun2’ respectively.
1. fun1 :: [Integer] -> Integer
fun1 [] = 1
fun1 (x:xs)
| even x = (x - 2) * fun1 xs
| otherwise = fun1 xs
2. fun2 :: Integer -> Integer
fun2 1 = 0
fun2 n | even n = n + fun2 (n ‘div‘ 2)
| otherwise = fun2 (3 * n + 1)
Hint: For this problem you may wish to use the functions iterate
and takeWhile. Look them up in the Prelude documentation to see
what they do.

func1 :: [Integer] -> Integer
func1 = product.map (\x -> x-2).filter even

fun1' :: [Integer] -> Integer
fun1' [] = 1
fun1' (x:xs)
  | even x = (x - 2) * fun1' xs
  | otherwise = fun1' xs

-- fun2 :: Integer -> Integer
